# Import each one of your sorting algorithms below as follows:
# Feel free to comment out these lines before your algorithms are implemented.
from insertion_sort import insertion_sort
from tim_sort import tim_sort
from shell_sort1 import shell_sort1
from shell_sort2 import shell_sort2
# from shell_sort3 import shell_sort3
# from shell_sort4 import shell_sort4
# from shell_sort5 import shell_sort5
# Please read the below carefully:
# - Each sorting algorithm should be implemented in its own file.
# - No file should include anything outside of standard Python libraries.
# - Functions should be tested using Python 3.6+ on a Linux environment.
# - Each function should modify the input list so that it is sorted upon
# completion.
# Note:
# If your Shellsort and/or other sort variants largely use the same code,
# you may choose to implement them in a single file, and import them as follows:
# from shell_sort import shell_sort1, shell_sort2, shell_sort3, shell_sort4,
# shell_sort5
